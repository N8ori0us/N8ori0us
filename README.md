- 👋 Hi, I’m Nathaniel Jackson. You can call me Nate.
- 👀 I’m like making music, cooking, connecting, creating, sunsets, long walks on the beach...😜 
LOL. Really thoough, I was living in windward Oahu, Hawaii until COVID and really miss the beaches.  
- 🌱 Recently completed several coding bootcamps and trying to get experience and hopefully find some work. Making this a career would be a dream but I am still pretty green and dont expect things to happen all that quick
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that anyone needs help with. The bootcamps opened my mind to the possibilities, what and how to study and build simple apps but I want to get as much experience working on real projects as possible.
