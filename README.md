- 👋 Hi, I’m @N8ori0us
- 👀 I’m interested in making music, cooking, connecting, creating, sunsets, long walks on the beach... 
LOL. Really thoough, I was living in windward Oahu, Hawaii until COVID and really miss the beaches.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code. HAHA I'm taking a course on bootstrap that's part of a full stack web/mobile
developement bootcamp through Nucamp rn but just completed their DevOps w/ Python & SQL bootcamp last month.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that anyone needs help with. The bootcamps are cursory and mostly
-show what's possible, what to study and how to build simple apps/ I need experience working on real projects.
